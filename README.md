Tournament Systems
------------------
Moderators can initiate tournaments and invite registered users to participate.
Therefore, several types of tournament systems, e.g. league (Round Robin),
knock-out (KO), Swiss or MacMahon are available.

Features
--------
Players will receive a schedule online, by email or vCal. During an ongoing tournament,
players will frequently get notifying emails about their next match.
Before a long-term match, e.g. in a league, the players can arrange a new date once.
Moderators provide help and can even rearrange dates in special cases.
Therefore, the owner of tournament can appoint moderators having the right to do so.
After a match, the players provide the result online. If the result is not provided during
a given period of time, the match is suspended automatically.
Moderators can provide help if the result input was not correct.

The portal provides i18n technology. It provides several languages and timezones. Language and timezone
are detected automatically, while the user can override by editing the profile.

Statistic & Rating
------------------
Players can see their results, standings and their tournament achievements online
and can download a certificate (PDF).
All matches are statistically evaluated and are provided online to the player. In addition,
several types of rating systems (EGF, AGA) are evaluated, too.

Privacy Protection
-------------------
To protect the player's privacy, each player has the opportunity to anonymize providing
a nick name. The complete name of a player is available to an admin only, so the player's
email. For communication an online chat system is provided.

Referees & Moderators
---------------------
Any tournament on the portal is bound to the tournament rules. These rules are open to anyone
on the portal. It is the player's right to make a request to a referee online.
Referees are appointed by an administrator. As the moderator, referees are anonymous and can act
as a team.

History
-------
The project was initiated by the Berlin Baduk Club e.V. in 12/2012. The first league started in 2013,
named Nakade-League. In 09/2014 a closed-beta test started, inviting players in Europe to participate.
In 2015, The Nakade-League started with 22 players participating from 3 countries and 6 cities.
In 02/2015, the portal provides two languages, English and German and just a single system  - league!
We hope to complete all requests in 2019.
